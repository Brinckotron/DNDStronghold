Ok, let's redo the whole Buildings Tab.

[COMPLETED] First, I need you to get rid of the buildings tab as it stands right now. clean it all up, as well as references to it in gamestateservice and other parts of the code. We will need a clean slate to start the new version. 

Then, we can begin working on my vision for the new version.

[COMPLETED] Left Side: Table
On the left, we should have a listview of all Buildings showing Name, Type, Workers(current/max), State (with % progress and weeks left if appropriate), condition, and level. Selecting a building in this listview loads the building's info in the details panel. Clicking the column labels should sort the list using the proper key(alphabetical order for Name and Type, number of assigned workers [from higher to lower] for Workers, [Complete, then UnderConstruction, then Planning, then Upgrading, then Repairing, then Damaged] for State, [Highest to lowest] for condition, [Highest to Lowest] for level).

[COMPLETED] Underneath the listview there should be a Add New Building button (use the logic from the current one)


Right Side: Details panel
On the right, we should have a panel with all the details of the selected building and the buttons to interact with it.


Workforce
- Worker Slots (current/max)
- Manage Workers button (use the logic from the currently existing one)
- Currently Assigned Workers (listview, NPC name, type and level, double click on worker sends to NPC tab with double clicked NPC selected)

Projects
- Current project (if any, with time remaining until completion and the list of workers assigned to it)
- Available Projects Button (available if at least one project available at current level, opens a popup form with available projects, text box for project descriptions, button to Begin project if possible [some projects might requires some resources to begin, and only one project can be active at a time], that opens another small popup to assign workers to project from the list of workers assigned to building)

I want you to take your time and not rush, let's do it one thing at a time, and we will review as you go along.

=== IMPLEMENTATION PLAN ===

[COMPLETED] MILESTONE 1: Basic Tab Structure and Left Side List View
- Add Buildings tab back to tab control
- Create basic two-panel layout (65%/35% fixed split)
- Implement ListView with columns:
  * Name
  * Type
  * Workers (format: "current/max")
  * State (includes progress and time: "State (progress%, timeLeft w)")
  * Condition (format: "XX%")
  * Level
- Add color coding for states:
  * Damaged: Red
  * Under Construction: Blue
  * Repairing: Orange
  * Others: Default color
- Style ListView with subtle grid lines
- Add "Add New Building" button:
  * Left-aligned
  * Standard button height
  * Small margin (8-10px) from ListView
- Initialize right panel with empty fields
Result: Functional tab with styled list view displaying buildings and basic layout structure

[COMPLETED] MILESTONE 2: Basic Sorting Implementation
- Implement Name and Type sorting (alphabetical)
- Implement Workers sorting (numerical)
- Implement State sorting (priority order)
- Implement Condition and Level sorting (numerical)
Result: Fully functional list with proper sorting

[COMPLETED] MILESTONE 3: Right Panel - Basic Information Section
- Create right panel layout structure
Basic Information
- Name (with rename button)
- Type
- Level with Upgrade button if available (unavailable if max level already reached. Pressing the button opens a small popup that shows the upgrade costs and the upgrade effects [ex: +1 worker slot, or +1 food/worker, etc.], with a cancel button and an Upgrade button that is unclickable if not enough resources)
- Status (with progress and time remaining, and Cancel button if in Planning state. Pressing cancel opens a popup asking are you sure you want to cancel? all resources will be refunded. Yes or No)
- Condition (with Repair button if not 100%. Pressing the button opens a small popup show the repair costs, with a cancel button and an repair button that is unclickable if not enough resources)
Result: Working details display when selecting buildings

[COMPLETED] MILESTONE 4: Production Section
- Collapsible section
- Production (listview with resource and amount)
- Implement double-click navigation to Resources tab
Result: Resource production visibility

[COMPLETED] MILESTONE 5: Upkeep Section
- Collapsible section
- Upkeep (listview, resource and amount)
- Implement double-click navigation to Resources tab
Result: Resource production visibility

[COMPLETED] MILESTONE 6: Workforce Management Section
- Collapsible section
- Add Worker Slots display
- Implement Manage Workers button and dialog
- Add Currently Assigned Workers ListView
- Implement double-click navigation to NPCs tab
Result: Complete worker management functionality

MILESTONE 7: Projects Section
- Collapsible section
- Add Current Project display
- Implement Available Projects button and dialog
- Add Project worker assignment functionality
Result: Complete project management system

Each milestone will be implemented and tested independently, maintaining a working application throughout development.
