## Technical Considerations

### State Management
- Use Redux Toolkit for global state
- Implement slice pattern for different domains (buildings, NPCs, etc.)
- Use selectors for derived data

### Performance Optimization
- Implement memoization for expensive calculations
- Use virtualized lists for large collections
- Optimize rendering with React.memo and useMemo

### Data Persistence
- Use localStorage for saving game state
- Implement auto-save functionality
- Add manual save slots
- Create export/import functionality for backups

### Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for core game logic
- Component tests for UI elements
- Integration tests for critical user flows
- Manual testing for gameplay balance

## Resource Allocation

### Frontend Development
- 1 Senior React Developer
- 1 UI/UX Designer
- 1 Junior Developer

### Game Logic Development
- 1 Game Systems Developer
- 1 Data Modeler

### Testing
- 1 QA Tester
- Game balance playtesting group

## Risk Assessment

### Technical Risks
- **Complex state management**: Mitigate with clear architecture and documentation
- **Performance issues with large strongholds**: Address with optimization techniques
- **Save data compatibility between versions**: Implement version migration system

### Game Design Risks
- **Balance issues**: Regular playtesting and adjustment
- **Feature creep**: Strict adherence to prioritized feature list
- **Complexity overwhelming users**: Implement progressive disclosure of features
